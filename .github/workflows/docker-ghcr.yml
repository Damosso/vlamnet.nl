name: Build and push Docker image to GHCR

# This workflow builds a Docker image from the project's Dockerfile and
# publishes it to the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) under the repository
# `ghcr.io/Damosso/vlamnet.nl`.  It runs on pushes to the `main` branch
# or when triggered manually via the GitHub Actions UI.
